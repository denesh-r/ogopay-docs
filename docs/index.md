# What is OGO Pay

**OGO Pay** is a payment gateway platform that enables you to accept credit and debit card payments in your web and mobile
applications.

+ [x] **VISA**, **MasterCard** and **Union Pay** cards are currently supported.  
+ [x] **Tokenization** is supported.  
        This gives you the ability to store your customers' payment methods. Thereby facilitating business models that involve
        non interactive payment flows used in subscriptions and introduce convenience in online stores and other ecommerce
        businesses.
+ [x] Only cards supporting **3DSecure** can be used.  
        3DSecure is an additional layer of authentication provided by card issuers to validate the card holder.
        The customer will be directed to his/her bank's webpage to validate a transaction via an OTP.
        We use this method to validate a card before tokenizing it.
+ [x] **Installment plans** are supported.  
        This allows your customer to split a large payment into equal monthly installments of his/her choice.
+ [x] **Preauth + Completion** model is supported.  
        Preauthorization allows you to verify funds in a customer's card and then complete the transaction at a later time.
        This enables business models that do not charge for the product or service on the same day such as hotel reservations
        and car rentals.
+ [x] Automated **daily  settlements.**  
        All successful sales transactions will be settled in your bank account the next business day.

Currently all merchants are required to have a *Commercial Bank* account to receive funds.  
Other banks will be supported in the near future.
